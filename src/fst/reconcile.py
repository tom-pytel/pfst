        - From in-tree `FST` means the source and nodes that is in the out tree is the same as the original parent in-tree
        `FST` and when encountering other in-tree `FST` nodes which have the same child path as the original tree with
        respect to the parent then nothing needs to be changed. Otherwise, if `FST` from same tree but at different
        location, it is copied from the marked tree and gauranteed to have original source and nodes for the branch. If
        `FST` from another tree then it is validated and if good attempted to copy with all its source and children, and
        then not recursed (since it is assumed to be unmodified if it validated). If fails validate or copy then its
        `AST` is put just like a pure `AST` would be discarding any formatting. For a new pure `AST` child, it is just
        put at the location and recursion is cuntinued with `node_parent=False` to indicate an `AST` recursion.

        - From pure `AST`, the same thing is done for an out-of-tree `FST` node as for the `FST` recursion. For a pure
        `AST`, nothing is changed as it was put with the original parent pure `AST` that recursed to here. Otherwise,
        on an in-tree `FST` node, it is copied and put with formatting from the marked tree and recursion continues
        with `node_parent` set to this node to indicate the in-tree `FST` recursion path.

        - `node_parent`: Has the following meanings:
            - `FST`: Coming from this in-tree `FST` parent.
            - `None`: Is tree `FST` root (no parent).
